The system allows them to easily manage the scholars that came from their school, wherein they can update the personal information of undergraduate scholars, as well as notify the CHED-CAR staff if a scholar has recently graduated.<br/><br/>The coordinators will also have a better time in generating a billing statement which is used by CHED-CAR in processing the payments for the scholars. This resolves the issue that, every semester, numerous HEIs are behind the schedule in submitting their billing statements to CHED-CAR resulting in delay in the processing of financial benefits for the scholars.</p>

Before, monitoring of applicants and scholars was manually done using spreadsheets which contain thousands of rows and would literally take days to finish.
