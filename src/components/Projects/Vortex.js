                        <h1>Landing Page</h1>
                        <p>The Vortex has a level-based, skill-centric gameplay with 3D visuals and well-defined level designs. The players will be welcomed with the menu and title screen and throughout the game, the color scheme used is only of blue, magenta, and white to achieve the uniformed minimalist aesthetic. Our team agreed that the simplicity of the design that we went for balances out the challenging obstacles the players should expect from the game which makes it exciting.</p>

                        <h1>20 Unique Levels</h1>
                        <p>Because The Vortex is an auto-runner where the objective is to reach the end of each level, the game is continuous but still split up into 20 levels. Every two levels have the same 3D geometric shape. For example, in levels 1 and 2, the shape will be a rectangular prism, while levels 3 and 4 have cubes as the obstacles. The players would have to finish the level that they are on before unlocking the next levels because they cannot choose a level greater than what they are on.</p>

                        <p>The Vortex is a first-person game wherein the player will steer through the series of tunnels by pressing the left or right arrow keys while avoiding different obstacles with increasing speed in order to survive all the levels. On the upper part of the screen, the distance traveled is shown in meters as well as the speed per second.</p>

Once hit with an obstacle at any part in the game, the player will automatically be directed at the beginning of the level when they choose the restart button and would have to start over.</p>
